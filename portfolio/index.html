    <p>My name is Magnus Wulff and I am 21 years old. I am currently a student at the Copenhagen Business Academy located in Lyngby. My line of study is called Multimediedesigner which translates to 'multimedia designer'.</p>
    <p>Growing up I was always very interested in computers and everything they were capable of. The ability to solve my own issues and answer my own questions fascinated me. But now, as time has passed, it's much bigger than that. Anything is possible, and your imagination is the limit.</p>
    <p>I, myself, have a broad interest in coding, programming and graphic design as well as an eager to learn. I have limited experience in the following programs: adobe photoshop, adobe xd, and the following languages: lua, html5 and css, but a challenge has never stopped me. Learning how to utilize the features of these and many more programs/languages allows me to express myself in any way I want.</p>
    <p>If I have caught your interest, head over to my 'contact' page!</p>
